# JukeBox
This is my Graduation project from Infotech Academy MCSD Course.

I used C#, HTML-CSS-JavaScript, .NET MVC Pattern, .NET Web API, .NET Identity, Entity Framework, Fluent API-Validation and T-SQL. 

The project is a Game Library Platform where users can download or upload their games mostly for Indie developers. 

The project is not yet finished and is only for reviewing purposes.
